If you’ve been to a Mediterranean style restaurant, than I’m pretty sure you have. They’re little fried balls traditionally made with a mix of ground chickpeas and herbs. They might not sound all that exciting, but they are, and extra delicious too. Even chickpea haters love a good falafel. And today’s falafel recipe is ever so delish. Loaded with plenty of flavor, good texture, and eaten with Naan.","directions":"     Add the carrots to a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Add the chickpeas, flour, sesame seeds, garlic, cumin and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Pulse until the mixture is combined and mostly smooth. Roll the dough into rounded teaspoon size balls.\n     Add a few inches of oil to the bottom of a heavy pot. Heat to 375 degrees F.\n     Fry the balls for 2-3 minutes or until golden and cooked through. Drain onto paper towels and then sprinkle lightly with salt.\n     To assemble, spread each piece of naan with yogurt, top with lettuce, falafels, avocado, and cucumber. Drizzle the ginger tahini and jalapeño sauce (both recipes below) over the falafels. Enjoy!\n\nJalapeño Sauce:\n\n     Combine all ingredients in a bowl. \n\nGinger Tahini:\n\n     Combine all ingredients in a bowl and whisk until completely smooth. Add water to thin the sauce to a drizzling consistency.
